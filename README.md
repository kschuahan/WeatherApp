# Weather App

A React Native weather application that allows users to search for current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city. This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and implements state management using Redux, navigation using React Navigation, and data caching using AsyncStorage.

## Features

- Search for weather by city name
- Display current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description)
- Display 5-day weather forecast (daily high/low temperatures, weather conditions)
- Navigation between different views using React Navigation
- State management using Redux and Redux Thunk for asynchronous API calls
- Caching weather data using AsyncStorage to reduce API calls
- Unit testing using Jest and React Native Testing Library
- Object-Oriented Programming principles applied in design




To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android



### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios


If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
